# ReGIR: Refine Geometry for Sigle-Image Implicit Representation (ICASSP2024)

## Contribution:
- A novel query point encoding utilizing pixel-aligned feature, voxel-aligned feature, and SDF.
- coarse-to-fine implicit model based on multi-level voxel-aligned feature for 3D human reconstruction.

This project is built upon ICON, and the core idea of the work is inspired by PIFuHD.
